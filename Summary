This Python code performs data processing, feature engineering, and builds a machine learning model using the Random Forest algorithm. Here's a brief summary of its working:

1. Data Cleaning: Missing values in numerical columns (Age, Fare) are replaced with the median, and in categorical columns (Embarked), the mode is used. Irrelevant columns are dropped (PassengerId, Name, Ticket, Cabin).


2. Feature Engineering:

Categorical variables (Sex) are encoded as numerical values.

New features (FamilySize, IsAlone, AgeGroup) are created to enhance prediction performance.



3. Preprocessing Pipeline:

Numerical features are scaled and imputed (missing values filled).

Categorical features are imputed and one-hot encoded.



4. Model Building: A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the preprocessed data. The pipeline transforms the training and test data.


5. Prediction & Evaluation: After training, the model predicts outcomes on the test set, and its accuracy is calculated and printed.
